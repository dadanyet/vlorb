Copyright (c) 2002, Jochem Kossen

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPENDS ON:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * cdparanoia, http://www.xiph.org/paranoia
 * Perl, http://www.perl.org
 * Perl CDDB module, http://www.cpan.org

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL DEPENDS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * An encoder, currently one of:
   - oggenc (vorbis-tools), http://www.vorbis.com
   - flac, http://flac.sourceforge.net
   Without one of those, vlorb will encode to WAV files using cdparanoia
 * VorbisGain (Ogg Vorbis ReplayGain), http://sjeng.org/vorbisgain.html
   For more information about ReplayGain, see http://replaygain.org

INSTALL PERL CDDB MODULE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are a number of ways to install the Perl CDDB module.
1) use a package from your operating system provider, usually the package is
   called 'perl-cddb' or something like that

2) download the perl-CDDB tarball from
   http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/R/RC/RCAPUTO/CDDB-1.08.tar.gz
   and install as follows:

 # tar -zxf /path/to/CDDB-1.08.tar.gz
 # cd CDDB-1.08
 # perl Makefile.PL
 # make
 # make install

3) Use Perl's automatic install method.
Type the following at your prompt:

 # perl -MCPAN -e shell
 cpan> install CDDB

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL VLORB:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # cd /tmp
 # tar -zxf /path/to/vlorb-1.2.tar.gz (where 1.2 is the version)
 # cd vlorb-1.2
 # make install

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UNINSTALL VLORB:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # cd /tmp
 # tar -zxf /path/to/vlorb-1.2.tar.gz (where 1.2 is the version)
 # cd vlorb-1.2
 # make uninstall

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT VLORB:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vlorb was based on Ratrip 1.3 by Amy Nugent ((c) 2002) which is a nice
program, but i didn't like the colors and interactivity. It also
lacked several features i wanted (specifying oggenc quality,
single-artist cd's, vorbisgain, etc.) and it had quite a few bugs.

Anyway, I shamelessly took his code, to morph it into vlorb. Open
Source rocks. At this point, there's only very little evidence left
behind which proves that vlorb was based on RatRip. For Ratrip, see
http://www.linuxrat.org

CREDITS (send me an email if i forgot about you):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Han Boetes, a LOT of things (OpenBSD port comes to mind) :)
 * Bas Kok, invented the 'to vlorb' verb
 * Bastiaan Cuppen, lots (suggestions, bugs, truckloads of strong black coffee)
 * Amy Nugent, wrote Ratrip
 * Jeroen Vloothuis, testing, making suggestions
 * You, for looking at this!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT (or, what vlorb is missing currently):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * optional colors, off by default (Han)
 * database/HTML/XML/command export or "catalogue creation" (jochem)
 * remaining time calculation (Bastiaan Cuppen)
 * nicer output (jochem)
 * editing of tags/cddb info before ripping
 * continue aborted rips (Bastiaan Cuppen and Jeroen Vloothuis)

RELEASE NOTES:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2:
 * Autodetection everywhere (apps, devices, ...)
 * FLAC support added (-e flac)
 * WAV support added (-e wav)
 * -v (vorbisgain) option changed to -r (replaygain)
 * -t option (switch artist and tracktitle info in case of bad CDDB info)
 * -f option (toggle on the fly mode)
 * configfile change: use_vorbisgain changed to use_replaygain
 * bugfix: vlorb -h didn't work in case of wrong option(s) configfile (reported
   by Bastiaan Cuppen)
 * bugfix: vlorb 1.1 didn't handle unknown CD's correctly (reported by Han
   Boetes)

1.1:
 * bugfix: double quotes were not properly escaped
 * vlorb will now autodetect if an audio cd is single-artist or
   multi-artist. If it detects wrongly, use the -s option to toggle
   single-/multi-artist.
 * the singleartist option from the configuration file was removed
 * show_progress (the -p option) mode was added. It shows oggenc
   encoding progress. It's off by default since it's pretty ugly.
 * better error checking/messages
 * added -m and -M options for specifying filemask and dirmask on the
   commandline

1.0:
 * during the 1.0pre versions the format of the configuration file
   changed a couple of times. It could be necessary to generate a new one
   using vlorb's -g flag.
 * Makefile is now FHS compliant and works under OpenBSD more easy
   too.
 * various bugfixes, cleanups and polish was made
 * rewritten manpage
